You need to add your own environment variables in the mailer1.py file

The application is under development to provide login and signup functionality with more flexibility to the users to save their data too.

Currently this website is not for deployment.

Users can't upload images from their own system.

We are trying to provide that opportunity to the users. But for the testing of website only saved images from our system will be used.

Website gives you results only if you provide the optically scanned images of the pcb both test and template.

Full version coming soon. :)

Python packages required:

tensorflow keras
